The Request System is used to request stuff that is not there in the library and you want to watch or listen. I try to fulfill them whenever I can.

## Using the Request System

* **Go to the request site. You can access it from the portal.**
* **Login With Your Account**
* **Use the same account that was created for streaming**
* **Use the search button to search a movie or show and click on the request button to request it**
* **For Shows use the drop down button to specify which seasons you want. If it is a very big show. like the office, then it might go over your weekly limit. In such case, just request the 1st season and I will give the complete series. If it is small series then you can request the entire series, or particular seasons or episodes. Use the select button to specify.**
* **Everyone has a weekly limit of 5 Movies and 30 episodes. It might decrease or increase depending on my time available.**
* **Use the Books and Audio-books link at the top to request books.**

## Reporting an Issue

**If you have any problems with a particular movie or show like bad quality or wrong subtitles, etc then use the report issue button to inform me about it.  
Search that particular Movie/Show and click on the report issue button. Use the drop down menu to select what type of issue it is.**

> **Remember that the report issue button is only present on shows/movies that are there in monkflix.**
