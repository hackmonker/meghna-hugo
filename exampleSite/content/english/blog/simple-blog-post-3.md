### Using the Request System

1. Go to the request site. You can access it from the portal.
2. Login With Your Account
3. Use the same account that was created for streaming
4.  Use the search button to search a movie or show and click on the request button to request it
5.  For Shows use the drop down button to specify which seasons you want. If it is a very big show. like the office, then it might go over your weekly limit. In such case, just request the 1st season and I will give the complete series. If it is small series then you can request the entire series, or particular seasons or episodes. Use the select button to specify.
6.  Everyone has a weekly limit of 5 Movies and 30 episodes. It might decrease or increase depending on my time available.

### Reporting an Issue

If you have any problems with a particular movie or show like bad quality or wrong subtitles, etc then use the report issue button to inform me about it.  
Search that particular Movie/Show and click on the report issue button. Use the drop down menu to select what type of issue it is. 

Remember that the report issue button is only present on shows/movies that are there in monkflix.
